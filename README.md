# 📊 Sales Distribution Analysis – Tableau Project

## 📌 Introduction
The **Sales Distribution Analysis** Tableau project delivers an integrated view of sales performance from both **value** (revenue) and **volume** (units sold) perspectives. It uses three interactive dashboards to help identify top-performing categories, products, customers, and seasonal patterns.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Measure and compare **sales revenue** and **sales volume** across different dimensions.
- Identify **top performers** and **low-performing segments**.
- Detect **seasonal sales patterns** to guide demand planning.
- Provide a **single source of truth** for sales insights in an interactive format.

## 📂 Data Source
The workbook uses an embedded dataset containing:
- **Product Data** – Category, Product Name
- **Customer Data** – Names, purchase details
- **Order Data** – Order Date, Quantity, Sales Value
- **Time Dimensions** – Monthly and yearly breakdown
